In this episode, veteran educator and coach [Vijender Singh Chauhan 'Masijeevi'](https://linktr.ee/pleasesitdown) demystifies the Civil Services Examination and provides useful tips for IAS aspirants; a passing thought for the occasions that demand "daring", and an interesting anecdote of an investment opportunity that the sharks refused in the recently concluded, maiden season, of [Shark Tank India](https://twitter.com/sharktankindia) show. Will they regret it, like the sharks from the original American show did 9 years ago?
