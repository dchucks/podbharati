#### “…(with) a distinctive style to their podcasts.. [the podcast kind of takes you back in time](/images/posts/startupdunia-interview.pdf), making you reminiscent of All India Radio’s Vividh Bharati shows. They cover a variety of current issues that affect the Indian society. Pretty insightful with a touch of serious journalism to it. Well worth your time.”
